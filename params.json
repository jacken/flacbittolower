{"name":"Flacbittolower","tagline":"Python script for downsampling music to a maximum frequency.","body":"# flacbittolower\r\nI wrote this script to auto convert my music library so that all music is below a specified frequency. The reason is that I use a Raspberry Pi as a music server and when using a Squeezebox V3 that is only capable of playing back 24-bit, 48khz, the server has to downsample the music on fly, something the Raspberry Pi isn't able to cope with. [Read more at why I need to downsample here](http://www.jackenhack.com/raspberry-pi-squeezebox-logitech-server/)\r\n\r\n**WARNING! Replaces original files, so do a backup before use!**\r\n\r\n## prerequisites\r\nYou need to install the following and maybe change the path in the script:\r\n* [FLAC](http://flac.sourceforge.net/)\r\n* [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)\r\n\r\nThis is one of my first Python scripts so put on darkened glasses to shield yourself if your a Python expert. Or even better, fix it!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
