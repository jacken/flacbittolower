# flacbittolower
I wrote this script to auto convert my music library so that all music is below a specified frequency. The reason is that I use a Raspberry Pi as a music server and when using a Squeezebox V3 that is only capable of playing back 24-bit, 48khz, the server has to downsample the music on fly, something the Raspberry Pi isn't able to cope with.

This is one of my first Python scripts so put on darkened glasses to shield yourself if your a Python expert. Or even better, fix it!
